              <p>
                DIGI KOEIN is created and developed by a group of the financial
                experts under the company of <span>Green Shark Limited</span> to
                prompt a technological innovation and to positively alter the
                financial industry practice and the life of people. The ways to
                use “Money” are below observed and divided into three
                categories: 1) Fund Transfer; 2) Payment and 3) Currency
                Exchanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the industry practice currently adopted, to some
                extent, hinders a full-fledged technological and economic growth
                in terms of the usage of Money. The global and independent
                platform created through DIGI KOEIN Blockchain/Distributed
                Ledger Technology shall get the divided ways of “Money” usage
                bundled and integrated to remove the current intermediaries, and
                to offer the alternative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The technology shall ultimately expand its horizon to be used in
                a variety of financial services including credits and loans,
                trade finance, and others. At this stage, it is certain that the
                market recognition and brand name of DIGI KOEIN will be
                explosively heightened.
